Key Concepts

Entity
Anything that can be numerated and segmented, such as people, households,
income, food-consumption, mobile-data-usage.

Dimensions
The attributes (e.g. age, gender etc) along which an entity can be segmented

Units of a dimension
The unique values each dimension can take (e.g. gender can be male, female,
Age could be 0-14,15-24 etc.). We assume each entity can only be mapped
to a single unit per dimension. (To be precise, each dimension also has an
"any" unit, which matches any unit. E.g person John will have 2 genders [male, any])

Segment
Each combination of possible dimension-units represents a segment
So [child,male,t1-metro] would be one segment (assuming we had a 3-dim segmentation scheme).
Each segment can also be thought as a cell in a N-dimensional matrix.

Segment Index (sid)
A sid identifies a segment using a single 64-bit (16-hex) number, via an encoding scheme.
Maxint is 2^63 (with one bit for sign) i.e  0x7fffffffffffffff
Each dimension is assigned a specific hexabit position. e.g. gender gets the rightmost hexbit
Thus, each dimension can have upto 15 possible dimension values (0x0 reserved for ANY).
Each dimension-unit is mapped to a specific hex-vale. Eg. gender:{male:0x1, female:0x2}
Thus, each segment will be represented by a single hex number.

Segmentation 
A segmentation scheme represents all the info about how the entity will be segmented
a) dimensions along which the entity will be segmented  (e.g. gender, age, tier)
b) units for each dimension         e.g. gender: (male, female)
c) the hex position of each dim     e.g  gender: 0,  age: 1, tier:2
d) hexcode for each unit            e.g. gender: {male:0x1, female:0x2}
e) how the entity is distributed along each unit of the dimension (e.g. male:0.51, female:0.49)
